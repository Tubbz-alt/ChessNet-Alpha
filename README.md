# ChessNet-Alpha
An chess AI which uses stochastic descent through a GANS architecture.

This code IS NOT well documented, if people care to read/use it, then I will do so.

In order to use this project you must go into the "Data" class and change "NPath" to the path of the "Wets" file on your machine, 
the same must be done for the "Path" string, but this one for your "Pieces" file path.
